This is the ExSite9 (EIF009) application.

The application is being built by [Intersect Australia](http://www.intersect.org.au/) for the [Australian National Data Service](http://www.ands.org.au) as part of the Fast Start program.

ExSite9 is a cross-platform Java desktop application, built using Eclipse RCP, that will allow researchers to indentify their research data files, "tag" their data files with descriptive metadata, and package their data files and associated metadata ready for submission to repositories.
